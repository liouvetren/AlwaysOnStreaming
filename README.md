# AlwaysOnStreaming
The project aims to build an autoscaling spark streaming cluster on Kunbernetes to provide a more granular resource management. A live dashboard will be built on this cluster to identify real-time toxic twitters.
## Why am I doing this?

## Data
Historic twitter data as a stream (python client Kafka producer)
